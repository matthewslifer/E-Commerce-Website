<h1>About this Project</h1>
This project is a mock E-Commerce Website that sells headphones, earphones, and speakers. The core technologies of this project include Sanity.io, Next.JS,
JavaScript, CSS, implementation of APIs, implementation of dependencies, implementation of packages, and CSS. This project utilizes sanity.io for the 
backend and management for the database. Sanity.io allows for quick deployment of the backend while making it easy to update and change products on the 
webpage without having to change any code within this project. The front end of this project was created using Next.JS. Utilizing Next.JS allows for 
quicker loading times and more efficient code writing. CSS was used to mimick a clean, modern, and user-friendly E-Commerce Website. The payment system is
powered by Stripe and demonstates working knowledge using APIs and building code to implement APIs. This project will not work if cloned out of the gate.
The dependencies for Sanity were not pushed to the Github repo. The user will need to have Sanity, Next.JS, and npm installed to get the project up and
working on a local server. Please checkout my code for this project and let me know of any bugs, issues, or feedback!
